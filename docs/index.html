<h1 id="backend">Backend</h1>
<p>All the source code for the backend lives in backend/. The app primarily uses Twilio API's to send and receive a message. It communicates with the COVID API using <a href="https://api.covid19api.com/">API</a>.</p>
<p>The API class is API and below is a short example of how it building the message.</p>
<pre><code>api = API(country=&quot;India&quot;)
api.getAll() # Gather all the data and store in a list of Data Objects. See backend/models/data.py
message = api.buildMessage() # Build the message that should be sent.</code></pre>
<p>This API and the Twilio SMS Sending and Receiving API IS glued together in the main Flask app (app.py)</p>
<h1 id="parser.py">parser.py</h1>
<p>The <code>BaseParser</code> Class is the crux of the parsing a given message. Currently the functionality is limited to a single command (<code>&quot;show me stats for &lt;country_name&gt;&quot;</code>) but as the application grows we would be adding more contextual features.</p>
<h1 id="build.py-and-build.json">build.py and build.json</h1>
<p>Inspired by package.json, I created a similar mechanism for the application. build.json is a simple JSON file where each key is the name of command followed by the command. <code>{   &quot;test&quot;: &quot;python run.py&quot; }</code></p>
<p>build.py is the script that matches all the commands and helps the user run the command. <code>python build.py test</code> will run the command &quot;python run.py&quot;</p>
<p>To add a new command, just add it to the build.json</p>
